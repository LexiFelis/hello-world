# hello-world
Dipping one's toes into the doing coding things and stuff.

ðŸ‘‹ **Hi folks!** I'm LexiFelis

I'm just setting things up as a newbie and have no clue what's going on beyond this Hello World guide.

**I'm currently:**
- Learning C# through FreeCodeCamp, with the intention of using Unity as a base for my first few projects.
- Gonna use this place to keep things more organised, I guess?
- Really, really bad at introductions.
